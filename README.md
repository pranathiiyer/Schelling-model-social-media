# An agent based model to understand the formation of echochambers on social media based on political ideologies
## This repository contains a course project that utilizes Schelling's Model to understand segregation of people along political ideologies on social media
Political ideologies of individuals are often a major driving force in discussions and discourse
on social media. This might even hold for conversations outside of the realm of politics itself
and might lead to creation of echo chambers of discussion online. In this project, I want to
understand if people (agents) tend to prefer being part of networks of people with similar
ideologies as theirs, whilst segregating themselves from other groups. In other words, does the
desire to follow and be surrounded by people of similar ideologies lead to disparate networks,
and more so how do these structures look like internally? 

To do this, I use the Schelling's agent based model. An elaborate context and process of the project can be found in "Context_process", and the python code for the project can be found in the jupyter notebook titled "Schelling model".
